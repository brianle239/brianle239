## About Me
#### Brian Le

Welcome to my GitHub page. Currently, I am enrolled at UCI and plan to graduate in 2025 with a Computer Science B.S degree.

Most of the projects uploaded in my repository include what I've created at UCI. Most of the projects are mainly **Python**, but I also have expertise in **Java**, **JavaScript**, **HTML/CSS**, **C++**, and **C**, and *MySQL**. 

Currently, I am working this summer at Northrop Grumman

Iâ€™m interested in learning and exploring full-stack software engineering and Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on front-end projects that involve HTML/CSS.
