## About Me
#### Brian Le

Welcome to my GitHub page. Currently, I am enrolled at UCI and plan to graduate in 2025 with a Computer Science B.S degree.

Most of the projects uploaded in my repository includes what I've created at UCI. Most of the projects are mainly **Python**, but I also have expertise in **Java**, **JavaScript**, **HTML/CSS**, and **R**. 

Iâ€™m interested in learning and exploring front end software engineering and Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on front end projects that involves HTML/CSS.
